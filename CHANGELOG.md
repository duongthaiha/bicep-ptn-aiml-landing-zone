# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  
This format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [v1.0.5] - 2026-04-01
### Fixed
- Fixed jumpbox Custom Script Extension using incorrect release tag. Replaced `install_script` URL field in `manifest.json` with `ailz_tag` field. The install script URL is now constructed from the tag in `main.bicep`, and the correct landing zone tag is passed to the `-release` parameter instead of the consumer repo tag.

### Documentation
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to reflect the `ailz_tag` field replacing `install_script`.

## [v1.0.4] - 2026-03-29
### Changed
- Made Cosmos DB throughput fully optional at both database and container levels using nullable types and safe access operators.
- Added `dbDatabaseThroughput` parameter (`int?`) for optional database-level throughput configuration.
- Container-level throughput and indexing policy are now optional via safe access (`container.?throughput`, `container.?indexingPolicy`).
- Default parameters no longer set throughput, aligning with the serverless Cosmos DB account configuration.

## [v1.0.3] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Simplified the default workload in `main.parameters.json` to a single Hello World container app (`orchestrator`) by removing GPT-RAG-specific defaults (`frontend`, `dataingest`, and `mcp`).
- Reduced default data resources by keeping only the `documents` storage container and `conversations` Cosmos DB container.
- Updated default chat model deployment from `gpt-4.1-mini` to `gpt-5-nano` and aligned model API versions to `2025-12-01-preview`.

### Removed
- Removed GPT-RAG-specific App Configuration keys from template defaults (`PROMPT_SOURCE`, `AGENT_STRATEGY`, and `AGENT_ID`).
- Removed tracked generated build artifact `main.json` from source control.

### Documentation
- Updated README container app role assignments to match current default configuration (Hello World `orchestrator` only).

## [v1.0.2] - 2026-03-17
### Fixed
- Fixed provisioning failures caused by unguarded references to outputs from optional resources when feature flags are disabled.
- Aligned App Configuration population with resource deployment toggles for Search, Key Vault, Storage, Container Apps, and Container Environment values.
- Aligned role-assignment loop conditions with `deployContainerApps` to prevent unsafe indexed references when Container Apps are disabled.
- Aligned user-assigned identity creation conditions with owning resource flags to avoid orphan identities.

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-03-06
### Fixed
- Fixed conditional references to Log Analytics outputs when `deployLogAnalytics=false`.
- Aligned App Insights, Private Link Scope, and scoped resources conditions with the Log Analytics flag.
- Prevented App Configuration values from referencing non-deployed Log Analytics/App Insights resources.

### Removed
- Removed all API Management (APIM) mentions and related configuration from the landing zone templates and constants.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-03-02
### Added
- Initial release of the Azure AI Landing Zone Bicep implementation.
